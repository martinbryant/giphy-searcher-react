# Giphy Searcher in React/Redux

Inspired by [5 Projects To Complete When Starting to Learn Front-End Web Development](https://medium.com/@GarrettLevine/5-projects-to-complete-when-starting-to-learn-front-end-web-development-48e8a1ce3178 "medium.com")

An excellent beginning application to build is a basic re-creation of the the giphy website, using the giphy api itself. I recommend their API for beginners because there is no need to request any kind of API key, and you won’t have to worry about much configuration when trying to request data.

Using their API you are able to build a small web app which does the following;

* Displays trending gifs on app load shown in a column/grid
* Has an input which allows you to search for specific gifs
* At the bottom of the results, there is a ‘load more’ button, which gets more gifs using that search term.

## Challenges
* Attempting TDD for the first time to complete this version
* Using Redux Middleware to validation the search term and make API calls
* I broke my wrist on 26 March 2018 and had surgery 2 weeks later

## Takeaways

* I feel more confident in using TDD going forward
* Using TDD helped when it came to debugging the application
* I have a much better understanding of using Redux middleware
